<p>If you&#8217;re thinking about applying to work for <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>, you might want to <a href="http://davemart.in/2015/04/22/inside-automattics-remote-hiring-process/">read this article first</a>. Dave Martin, Creative Director at Automattic, published an in-depth look behind the scenes of the remote hiring process for the design and growth portion of the company. He explains the five step process in detail which gives future applicants a good idea of what to expect.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating read and I learned that every part of the process has a purpose. For instance, every trial project consists of work that would normally be completed by existing exmployees. Every question asked by Martin in the interview process has a purpose, whether it&#8217;s to glean information or get a feel for how the applicant communicates.</p>
<p>The one area of the hiring process I&#8217;ve routinely seen scrutinized by those who don&#8217;t make the cut is the lack of specific feedback on why they&#8217;re not a good fit for a position. Dave Clements, who <a href="https://www.davidclements.me/2014/04/01/experience-trial-automattic/">almost made it to the final stage</a> of the hiring process, criticized the lack of detail from Automattic on why he wasn&#8217;t a good fit.</p>
<blockquote><p>My only criticism of my whole process from start to finish is that I wish they would have gone into more detail into on why I was not a good fit for them. They had been so verbose and open up to that point about any question that I asked of them, but when I asked why they had come to the decision to not move forward, I was given a fairly generic response as they &#8216;couldn‚Äôt go into too much detail&#8217;.</p></blockquote>
<p>Martin tries to do his best to highlight why someone is not a good fit, but the process is not easy and the number one goal is to hire the best people.</p>
<blockquote><p>If things don‚Äôt end up working out, I‚Äôll do my best to highlight why. At this point the applicant has invested quite a bit of time. I try to be as specific as possible as to why they are not going to proceed to a final interview.</p>
<p>Telling people no is hard, but mistakenly bringing on the wrong people can be much worse. While you want to always be kind, and helpful to all applicants, your primary responsibility when hiring is to ensure that only the best people get hired. That is priority number one.</p></blockquote>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a distributed company or someone who&#8217;s interested in working for one, there is plenty to learn from the post. I also encourage you to read this <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/04/the-ceo-of-automattic-on-holding-auditions-to-build-a-strong-team">Harvard Business Review article</a> from 2014 featuring Matt Mullenweg, on holding auditions to build a strong team.

<p>Nick Haskins launched <a href="https://story.am/" target="_blank">Story.am</a> earlier this year as a hosted storytelling platform that offers all the features of <a href="http://wptavern.com/?s=Aesop+Story+Engine" target="_blank">Aesop Story Engine</a>. Initially, the platform was only available to paying customers, but this week Haskins announced that Story.am is <a href="https://story.am/story-am-re-launch/" target="_blank">now available to everyone for free</a>.</p>
<p>The platform had not received much feedback in the several months it has been open to customers, so Haskins decided to remove all barriers to account creation.</p>
<p>&#8220;We really want feedback on <a href="https://lasso.is/" target="_blank">Lasso</a>, our visual web editor on Story.AM,&#8221; he said. &#8220;By making it free, we hope to garner a lot of feedback, even if that feedback isn&#8217;t good. Often times, that type of feedback is the best.&#8221;</p>
<p>In our <a href="http://wptavern.com/introducing-lasso-a-new-frontend-editor-for-wordpress" target="_blank">recent review of Lasso</a>, Jeff Chandler found that the product wasn&#8217;t quite polished enough for prime time but that it has potential. Haskins is hoping to build a broader network of Lasso users who will offer the feedback he needs to improve the editing experience.</p>
<p>Immediately following his announcement that Story.am accounts are now available for free, Haskins was averaging one signup a minute.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p>Newsletter out, story.am now averaging one signup a minute for the last few minutes. &#10;&#10;The power of free.</p>
<p>&mdash; Nick Haskins (@nphaskins) <a href="https://twitter.com/nphaskins/status/591359988309708800">April 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>&#8220;Since the announcement yesterday evening there have been about 130 signups, so we&#8217;ve calmed down to about 5-7 signups an hour,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>Story.am is a multisite installation that was built to be elastic and ready to scale. In the future, Haskins will open up a Pro level that will offer additional features such as the ability to sell story subscriptions with Stripe and use your own domain.</p>
<p>&#8220;The domain mapping and ability to sell story subscriptions are all in place and ready to go,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But rather than just releasing a Pro level straight away, I&#8217;m interested to see if what I THINK users want, is actually inline with what they REALLY want.&#8221;</p>
<p>Haskins is taking notes of trends while monitoring the signups to get a better picture of how people plan to use Story.am.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m seeing a lot of what I would describe as &#8216;people who aren&#8217;t necessarily writers but want to tell stories,'&#8221; he said. &#8220;The domains that are coming across include terms like comic, pastor, fish, school, etc. It&#8217;s quite interesting to see. We are tracking everything in great detail, so as time goes on we&#8217;ll begin to have some solid metrics.&#8221;</p>
<p>Many Story.am users are using the platform in the education space, a trend which has continued since opening up the site to free accounts. The platform is also open to bloggers, but Haskins is not aiming to compete with WordPress.com.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to see folks use stories in their own unique ways, with their own flair, and I think this will be tough to come by on a &#8216;generalized&#8217; network. i.e, one that basically treats everyone as the same,&#8221; he said. &#8220;One thing I don&#8217;t want to purposefully do is compete with WordPress.com. I&#8217;d much rather work with them to bring our ideas and tools to their platform, in some way, shape, or form.&#8221;</p>
<p>Story.am has no current ETA for launching Pro level features, but Haskins said that he will be gauging the demand and gathering feedback before moving on monetizing the platform. If you&#8217;re curious about how Aesop Story Engine components work with WordPress and want to try the new Lasso frontend editor, it&#8217;s now as easy as signing up for a free account on <a href="https://story.am/">Story.am</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 22:18:11 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>One of the highlights of the recent <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-powell-is-now-available-for-download" target="_blank">WordPress 4.2</a> release is the <a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design" target="_blank">completely revamped Press This interface</a>. The feature&#8217;s intended purpose is to make it easy to share text, images, and videos from around the web in a quick post, but many users are newly captivated by Press This&#8217; new minimalist design for post creation.</p>
<p>Once you try Press This for publishing, you may become some so partial to the posting form that you don&#8217;t want to go back to the standard post editor. It includes only the most essential formatting buttons and a button to add media, with all other extraneous selections for post formats, categories, and tags collapsed.</p>
<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/press-this-new-post/" target="_blank">Press This New Post</a> is a new plugin, created by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/drewapicture/" target="_blank">Drew Jaynes</a>, that gives you quick access to the Press This posting form from the &#8216;+ New&#8217; drop-down in the toolbar.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new-post.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42776]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42787" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new-post.jpg?resize=888%2C405" alt="press-this-new-post" /></a></p>
<p>The link takes you to the Press This editor where you can scan a URL or simply start writing a new post.</p>
<p>In the plugin&#8217;s description, Jaynes refers to the easy access as &#8220;Quick Draft on steroids,&#8221; but it may also become a real substitute for WordPress&#8217; dearly-departed <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-zen-mode-5-compelling-reasons-to-turn-on-distraction-free-writing" target="_blank">zen mode</a>. Many users are distracted by the sliding side menu and the fading of non-essential parts of the editor that was introduced in WordPress 4.1 when the <a href="http://wptavern.com/focus-project-and-session-ui-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-1" target="_blank">Focus Project was merged into core</a>. These animations are guaranteed not to happen to you in Press This mode.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pop-tarts.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42776]"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42794" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/pop-tarts.jpg?resize=974%2C534" alt="pop-tarts" /></a></p>
<p>Jaynes is a regular user of the Press This post editor, which was one of his motivations for creating the quick access plugin.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already drafted three blog posts using it instead of the standard editor,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Obviously in most cases I finish up in the standard editor, but I really like the posting interface.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think if we get to the point where Press This supports other post types and/or even other sites in a multisite network, it could really save a lot of time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Press This team is actively working on continuing to iterate the feature along those lines and both <a href="https://twitter.com/michaelarestad" target="_blank">Michael Arestad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/stephdau" target="_blank">Stephane Daury</a> have stepped up as core component maintainers.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know for a fact that they both have future plans for improving and iterating it,&#8221; Jaynes said. &#8220;It‚Äôs actually really cool to see a continuation of the passion beyond a feature plugin getting merged.&#8221;</p>
<p>Michael Arestad recently posted his thoughts on <a href="http://blog.michaelarestad.com/2015/04/23/pressed-it/" target="_blank">the future of Press This</a> and listed a host of features that the team is looking at adding:</p>
<ul>
<li>Split button (gonna be awesome)</li>
<li>Some rearranging of components</li>
<li>Improved tags UI</li>
<li>Featured image</li>
<li>Browser extensions</li>
<li>Site switching</li>
<li>Image flow improvements are in the works, which should drastically improve the media experience in both editors</li>
<li>Improved NUX flow</li>
</ul>
<p>With its committed maintainers, the Press This feature is well-positioned to evolve to support more diverse content types, which may attract even more users than the bookmarklet does in the long run. If you&#8217;re still thinking of Press This as just a simple bookmarklet for re-posting content, you may want to revisit it. The feature has the potential to influence future iterations of the standard post editor, which suddenly seems a little cluttered.</p>

She&#8217;s used WordPress for more than 10 years and has knowledge of the developing tech scene in Jamaica. In this interview, we learn how she discovered WordPress, the Jamaican WordPress community, and if the country will ever host a WordCamp.</p>
<p><strong>How long have you used WordPress?</strong></p>
<p>I just celebrated my 10th anniversary. I started using WordPress in 2005 and my first post was on April 2nd, 2005.</p>
<p><strong>What is your WordPress origin story?</strong></p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WPProfileOriginStory.png" rel="prettyphoto[42752]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42763" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/WPProfileOriginStory.png?resize=736%2C227" alt="As seen on the WordPress profile page" /></a>As seen on the WordPress profile page
<p>I was working at IBM at the time and finally decided I liked the idea of having my own <a href="http://biancawelds.com/">personal website</a>. The more I thought about it, the more I realized I wanted to have a blog as well as a static site. I knew I could build an HTML site myself, so I researched this blogging thing, and I found <a href="https://www.blogger.com/home">Blogspot</a>. Within a day of signing up, I became frustrated at not being able to customize it, so I looked for alternatives. I came across WordPress and fell in love, purchased a hosting account, installed it, and never looked back.</p>
<p><strong>What is the tech scene like in Jamaica?</strong></p>
<p>The tech scene is currently developing nicely. There has been a lot of slow foundation growth over the last decade, but in the last few years, we have seen some dramatic acceleration. The tech meetup, <a href="http://kingstonbeta.com/">Kingston Beta</a>, grew to hosting a regional conference called <a href="http://connectimass.com/media-2/community-events/connect-events-networks/caribbean-beta/">Caribbean Beta</a>.</p>
<p>The Slash Roots Developer Community saw the formation of the <a href="http://slashroots.org/">Slash Roots Foundation</a> which does a lot of work in the Open Data space. It expanded to organize the <a href="http://developingcaribbean.org/">Developing the Caribbean</a> conference, and was instrumental in the formation of <a href="http://codeforthecaribbean.org/">Code for the Caribbean</a>.</p>
<p>Startup events have been growing with our first Startup Weekend taking place in 2013. The Digital Jam Mobile Application competition was held for three years along with several other initiatives. The first <a href="http://venturecapitaljamaica.com/conference/about">Venture Capital Conference</a> was held in 2013 where the first formal angel investor group, <a href="http://www.firstangelsja.com/">First Angels</a>, was created. <a href="http://www.start-upjamaica.com/en/p/list/57094">StartUpJamaica</a> is our first accelerator and it launched last year with over 200 applications, where 36 teams participated in boot camps and training. This is a small sample of the things that are happening in our space.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a vibrant WordPress community in Jamaica?</strong></p>
<p>Vibrant on an individual level perhaps. There is no active WordPress community at present. There are a lot of WordPress sites being built and a lot of WordPress blogs being run, but they are more or less individual efforts with no real communication or collaboration to grow and develop a community.</p>
<p>I have recently started putting out feelers to see if there is enough interest in starting a regular WordPress meetup. In the last week, I&#8217;ve had interest from about two dozen people.</p>
<p><strong>To date, there has not been a WordCamp in Jamaica. Do you think there will ever be one and will you help organize it?</strong></p>
<p>I hope there will be and I definitely want to be a part of it. The first goal though would be to get the meetups going and gather a core community, so that&#8217;s my focus now.</p>
<p><strong>Have you ever attended a WordCamp? If not, which one will be your first?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, I have never attended any WordCamps. I am working on changing that in the near future by going to <a href="http://miami.wordcamp.org/2015/">WordCamp Miami</a> which is the nearest one to Jamaica.</p>

<p><strong>What do you like most about WordPress and what do you like the least?</strong></p>
<p>My favorite thing about WordPress is its flexibility. While it may not be the perfect solution for every challenge, there are few things that cannot be done. My least favorite thing is how much there is to learn to truly take full advantage of its power.</p>
<p><strong>If you wanted people to know something about Jamaica, what would it be?</strong></p>
<p>The one thing I always try to share when I am <strong>the Jamaican</strong> in the crowd is that, Jamaica is so much more than beaches, weed and reggae. It definitely has those, but there are so many other aspects to our geography, our culture and our people who outsiders don&#8217;t yet fully grasp. But the world is learning.</p>

There&#8217;s no information about the release on the <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32051">Make WordPress Core</a> site or the official <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/">WordPress news blog</a>. However, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.1.3">this Codex article</a> explains what&#8217;s in 4.1.3 and the reason it was released.</p>
<blockquote><p>Fix database writes for esoteric character sets, broken in the WordPress 4.1.2 security release. Neither UTF-8 nor latin1 were affected. For more information, see <a class="external text" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32051">ticket #32051</a>.</p></blockquote>
<p>The ticket contains a lengthy technical discussion of a critical bug and what was done to fix it. In addition to 4.1.3, the patch was merged into the following versions:</p>
<ul>
<li>3.7.7</li>
<li>3.8.7</li>
<li>3.9.5</li>
<li>4.0.3</li>
</ul>
<p>Since these are point releases, sites running WordPress 3.7 and higher will automatically update unless the server doesn&#8217;t support it or they&#8217;re disabled. If you&#8217;re running an old version of WordPress, I highly encourage you to update to 4.2. Not only does it have <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-powell-is-now-available-for-download">some nifty new features</a>, but it also fixes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&type=defect+%28bug%29&version=%21&version=%21trunk&resolution=fixed&milestone=4.2&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=owner&col=priority&order=priority" target="_blank">231 defects</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 04:25:35 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<h3>The consistency of WordPress</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2,&nbsp;<a href="http://wordpress.org/news/2015/04/powell/">Powell</a>,&nbsp;marks the impressive sixth major version in a row on a four month average development cycle.</p>
<ul>
<li>WordPress 3.7: October 24th, 2013</li>
<li>WordPress 3.8: December 12th, 2013</li>
<li>WordPress 3.9: April 16th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.0: September 4th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.1: December 18th, 2014</li>
<li>WordPress 4.2: April 23rd, 2015</li>
</ul>
<p>This streak of consistency in WordPress releases is not accidental. Groundwork was put in place organizationally, technically, and philosophically to help ensure consistent, iterative improvements for WordPress.</p>
<p>The project has always been quite good at updates, if compared to competition. However, a few releases prior to 3.7 got sidetracked, distracted, or thrown off schedule if held to our own high standard.</p>
<p>Concepts such as the introduction of <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">feature plugins</a> have helped put sanity and routine into the release schedule, even without repeat release leads these last six versions (and none will repeat at least through 4.4).</p>
<h4>Features of WordPress 4.2</h4>
<h3>Press This</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12436" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-wp-752x517.png" alt="press-this-wp" width="752" height="517" /></p>
<p>It‚Äôs quite possible even long term WordPress users have never heard of, much less used, Press This. However, the bookmarklet makes sharing and publishing others‚Äô articles on your own blog quite simple.</p>
<p>It was long overdue to either be cut from core or completely revamped. It was completely revamped under the ‚Äúfeature as plugin‚Äù model, led by Michael Arestad.</p>
<p>I‚Äôve been using the new Press This or a while now on my personal blog, and it‚Äôs really great. If your goal is to blog more regularly, and you like to curate or share what you‚Äôre reading/watching, you‚Äôll love Press This. You can find the bookmarklet in the admin and primary Tools page.</p>
<p>The editor is modern and honestly a great prototype for what could be a future full WordPress editor. The bookmarklet sits in my bookmarks, and it‚Äôs encouraged me to more often blog my thoughts on what I read ‚Äî versus leave my thoughts with a single Tweet.</p>
<p>I was at first on the fence as to whether Press This made sense to get a revamp. I‚Äôm now convinced it was a great decision, and the team that worked on most of the features was outstanding.</p>
<p>There are more features coming to Press This. You can check some of them out <a href="http://blog.michaelarestad.com/2015/04/23/pressed-it/">on Michael‚Äôs blog post</a> celebrating its inclusion in 4.2. If you‚Äôve never pressed anything with Press This, definitely give it a shot.</p>
<h3>Customizer Theme Switcher</h3>
<p>Another feature plugin that made it into 4.2 is the Customizer Theme Switcher. Relatively self-explanatory, this feature brings the theme choosing experience to the customizer.</p>
<p>The project was lead by Nick Halsey, and you can find the core proposal for the feature <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/02/11/customizer-theme-switcher-feature-plugin-merge-proposal/">on the Make WordPress blog</a>. Not many folks using WordPress as a full CMS will change themes that often, but for those that do, the move for selecting and testing themes to the customizer makes sense.</p>
<h3>Shiny Updates</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-12438" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/shiny-updates.png" alt="shiny-updates" width="707" height="391" /></p>
<p>Shiny Updates allows for inline updates directly in the plugins admin screen, without a redirect to the funky plugin update progression page you‚Äôre probably quite familiar with.</p>
<p>Shiny Updates is part of a larger effort for making both updates and installs better. Due to some potential UX issues and in order to stick with the release schedule, shiny installs was postponed. However, in a future release, the install and activation process for plugins will be a simpler process as well.</p>
<h3>Utf8mb4 support to enable special characters and emoji</h3>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-12437" src="https://poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/4.2-characters-752x626.png" alt="4.2-characters" width="752" height="626" /></p>
<p>WordPress can now handle all sorts of special characters by default, including Chinese, but also various glyphs and other symbols. And yes, emoji.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most discussed and also misunderstood feature of WordPress 4.2, Utf8mb4 makes WordPress more accessible in more languages, and that is awesome.</p>
<p>Also, don‚Äôt kid yourself: everyone loves emoji. As WordPress is used more as a mobile app backend, this change will be especially welcome. Can you imagine an app that didn‚Äôt support emoji? Of course not. <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f389.png" alt="üéâ" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>By the way, there is <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji">a handy Codex article</a> that details how to enable the emoji keyboard on various operating systems.</p>
<h3>Notes on developer features</h3>
<p>There are some great developer features in WordPress 4.2 as well. I highly recommend reading Aaron Jorbin&#8217;s <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/23/wordpress-4-2-field-notes/">field notes post</a> that details some of the key features for developers and also has links to detailed posts to cover each one.</p>
<h3>An excellent release</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2 is an excellent release that has a nice balance of new features, fixes, and developer enhancements.</p>
<p>Congratulations to the core team and everyone that was involved in the release of WordPress 4.2, &#8220;Powell&#8221;.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 24 Apr 2015 03:12:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

I tried to set the user agent to something different, but it still wasn&#8217;t working:</p>
<p><code>$response = wp_remote_get($url, array(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'timeout' => 20,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'User-Agent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0'<br />
));</code></p>
<p>Thankfully, <a href="http://ottopress.com">Otto</a> spotted my problem. The `user-agent` key needs to be lowercase so that it is picked up properly by the WordPress core code. This works:</p>
<p><code>$response = wp_remote_get($url, array(<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'timeout' => 20,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;'<b>u</b>ser-<b>a</b>gent' => 'Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.8; rv:20.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/20.0'<br />

This release expands the capabilities of Jetpack&#8217;s centralized site management to include menus. If you have <a href="http://jetpack.me/support/site-management/" target="_blank">Jetpack Manage</a> activated, you can now log into WordPress.com to manage menus for any of your sites that have opted in.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/menu-management.png" rel="prettyphoto[42711]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/menu-management.png?resize=700%2C404" alt="menu-management" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42721" /></a></p>
<p>The benefit of going to WordPress.com to manage menus for self-hosted sites was not immediately evident for those who don&#8217;t make use of the centralized site management feature. The interface is different and the dashboard contains a limited set of site management controls.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/pollyplummer">@pollyplummer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/jetpack">@jetpack</a> I can‚Äôt think of any. Aside from how weird that is, the disconnect isn‚Äôt intuitive. Solutions in search of problems.</p>
<p>&mdash; John Parris (@John_Parris) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Parris/status/591370442839056384">April 23, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>For those who manage just one or two sites, it isn&#8217;t clear why you would opt to log into WordPress.com instead of your site&#8217;s admin panel, which is essentially the command center, where everything is at your disposal.</p>
<p>Jetpack representative Jeremy Herve <a href="https://twitter.com/jeherve/status/591342288867106816" target="_blank">explained</a> that the primary benefits of the menu management feature are applicable &#8220;when working on multiple sites, when on mobile, and when you don&#8217;t want to log into the self-hosted site.</p>
<p>&#8220;I must also admit than I&#8217;m not the biggest fan of the Menus interface in WordPress.org,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s confusing for new users.&#8221;</p>
<p>If you prefer WordPress.com&#8217;s menu manager and posting interface but want to retain the freedom of self-hosting your site, then Jetpack Manage may be a good fit for you. If the disconnected, dissimilar interfaces don&#8217;t make sense for managing your sites, then there&#8217;s no need to activate it. Currently, bulk plugin management across multiple sites seems to be the most popular use of Jetpack Manage.</p>
<p>The 3.5 release also includes a dozen bug fixes and a few small enhancements.

It is named for <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bud_Powell" target="_blank">Earl Rudolph &#8220;Bud&#8221; Powell</a>, an American jazz pianist. This release, <a href="http://wptavern.com/drew-jaynes-to-lead-wordpress-4-2" target="_blank">led by 10up engineer Drew Jaynes</a>, offers a balanced mix of front-facing features that users will enjoy, as well as improvements for developers. Here is a tour of the highlights.</p>
<h3>Press This Overhauled</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new.png" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/press-this-new.png?resize=986%2C531" alt="press-this-new" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42649" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 contributors have brought the Press This feature back to life with a <a href="http://wptavern.com/pressthis-revamped-with-a-new-user-interface-and-minimalist-design" target="_blank">completely revamped interface</a> that makes it easy to share content from any website. It allows you to grab text, images, and videos, quickly add your thoughts, and publish. Any media is automatically added to your media library during the process. Add the bookmarklet from the Tools screen to your browser&#8217;s bookmark bar or your mobile desktop to jump start your publishing.</p>
<h3>Switch Themes in the Customizer</h3>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customizer-theme-switcher.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/customizer-theme-switcher.jpg?resize=1025%2C473" alt="customizer-theme-switcher" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-38931" /></a></p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 makes it possible to <a href="http://wptavern.com/customizer-theme-switcher-approved-for-merge-into-wordpress-4-2" target="_blank">switch themes in the customizer</a>.  Users can now browse through themes that have already been installed and activate a new one without ever leaving the frontend. This further streamlines the UI for customizing your site and paves the way for the theme installation process to be added to the customizer in the future.</p>
<h3>Expanded 4-Byte Unicode Character Support, Including Emoji</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/emoji-support.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/emoji-support.jpg?resize=1025%2C512" alt="emoji-support" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42652" /></a></p>
<p>This release changes database character encoding from  utf8mb3 to utf8mb4, which makes it possible for WordPress to <a href="http://wptavern.com/emoji-enables-wordpress-to-natively-support-chinese-korean-and-japanese-characters" target="_blank">natively support Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters</a>. The character encoding update also opens up a whole new world for using musical and mathematical symbols, hieroglyphs, and <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Emoji" target="_blank">emoji</a>. Emoji support has been added everywhere, and you can even <a href="http://www.brandonkraft.com/b/2015/03/emoji-wordpress-and-you/" target="_blank">use them in URLs</a>, if you&#8217;re adventurous.</p>
<h3>Enhanced Plugin Updates</h3>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/new-plugin-updates.png" rel="prettyphoto[42641]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/new-plugin-updates.png?resize=657%2C325" alt="new-plugin-updates" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42658" /></a></p>
<p>After you update to 4.2, you will be able to update plugins on the plugins screen without refreshing the page and without being whisked away to a new update screen. This makes it a more intuitive process and cuts down on the clicking required to manage your site in the admin. It is also the first stepping stone toward <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-radically-improves-the-plugin-install-and-update-process" target="_blank">improving the plugin installation process</a> to provide the same convenient experience.</p>
<h3>Improvements Under the Hood</h3>
<p>In addition to all the front-facing improvements, WordPress 4.2 includes some equally exciting updates for developers.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/new-plugin-detects-shared-terms-in-wordpress-ahead-of-taxonomy-term-splitting-in-4-2" target="_blank">Taxonomy Term Splitting</a> &#8211; terms shared across multiple taxonomies will now be split when one of them is updated.</li>
<li>Complex Query Ordering &#8211; <code>WP_Query</code>, <code>WP_Comment_Query</code>, and <code>WP_User_Query</code> now support complex ordering with named meta query clauses.</li>
<li>JavaScript Accessibility &#8211; Send audible notifications to screen readers in JavaScript with <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/accessibility/2015/04/15/let-wordpress-speak-new-in-wordpress-4-2/" target="_blank">wp.a11y.speak()</a>. Pass it a string, and an update will be sent to a dedicated ARIA live notifications area.</li>
<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/04/23/tinymce-views-api-improvements/" target="_blank">TinyMCE views API improvements</a> &#8211; this API is not yet ready for production but developers are welcome to test and experiment with it.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Many More Small Improvements</h3>
<p>WordPress 4.2 is also packed full of subtle refinements that make it more beautiful and easier to use. The <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-introduces-subtle-refinements-to-the-default-admin-color-scheme" target="_blank">default admin color scheme has been updated</a> every so slightly to be more harmonious to the eyes and more consistent with WordPress&#8217; branding.</p>
<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-2-will-automatically-enable-pretty-permalinks-for-new-sites-on-installation" target="_blank">Pretty permalinks are now automatically enabled</a> for new sites on installation. In most cases, administrators on new sites will never be greeted with ugly permalinks again, saving a step in the setup process.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds" target="_blank">oEmbed white list</a> has been updated to include Tumblr.com and Kickstarter, so you can easily paste links into the post editor and have the content instantly appear.</p>
<p>WordPress 4.2 fixes <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&status=assigned&status=closed&status=new&status=reopened&status=reviewing&type=defect+(bug)&version=!&version=!trunk&resolution=fixed&milestone=4.2&col=id&col=summary&col=milestone&col=status&col=type&col=owner&col=priority&order=priority" target="_blank">231 defects</a>, thanks to the volunteer efforts of 283 contributors. A complete list of all the changes in this release is available in the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.2" target="_blank">4.2 codex page</a>.

<p>The punk Wapuu was <a href="http://wptavern.com/scott-evans-on-designing-the-punk-wapuu-for-wordcamp-london-2015" target="_blank">created for WordCamp London 2015</a> by Scott Evans with collaboration from the event&#8217;s organizing team. The mascot was so well-received that Evans&#8217; colleagues urged him to see if it could land in the swag store.</p>
<p>&#8220;I supplied the vector artwork and some guidance and passed it on to Hello Merch which did the rest,&#8221; he said. Within approximately three weeks the t-shirt was made available for sale.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s unusual to see new items added to the WordPress Swag Store, but the iconic Wapuunk mascot seems to be an instant hit with swag collectors.</p>
<p>&#8220;After all the buzz of WordCamp London it seemed worth a go,&#8221; Evans said. &#8220;After all, they are different from the official WordCamp t-shirts we made. I think lots of folk were keen to see Wapuunk on a t-shirt.&#8221;</p>
<p>In contrast to the simple WordPress logo-branded items, Wapuunk and other variations of the mascot have a unique way of linking the local culture and/or an event experience with the logo. Wapuu variations illustrate the variety of WordPress communities around the globe. They evoke a strong connection between the software and the local community.</p>

<p>The WordPress Theme Review team made a major decision this week to <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/21/this-weeks-meeting-important-information-regarding-theme-options/" target="_blank">enforce the use of the native customizer</a> on new themes submitted to the directory. Theme authors who want to include customization options will no longer be able to create their own settings panels but will be required to follow the new customizer standard, effective immediately.</p>
<p>Existing themes in the directory will have six months to comply before the Theme Review Team starts to enforce the new requirement. To facilitate this process the team is preparing a series of posts and better documentation on how to use the customizer.</p>
<p>Theme Review Team member Justin Tadlock <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1429641246005571" target="_blank">brought the matter to a vote</a> during the last meeting:</p>
<blockquote><p>I&#8217;m proposing that we do an outright ban on custom settings screens in the admin. The plan was to allow theme authors to naturally move over to the customizer given time. This hasn&#8217;t worked.</p></blockquote>
<p>As attempts to standardize the use of the customizer in new themes have not been successful, the Theme Review Team has opted to draw a hard line, as gatekeepers to the official directory. For the most part, reactions to the new guidelines have been positive, but theme authors who incorporate other options frameworks are not thrilled about having to rewrite their options for the customizer.</p>
<h3>Will the Customizer Requirement Stifle Innovation for Theme Developers?</h3>
<p>While many developers agree that the customizer is WordPress&#8217; strongest option right now for providing live previews on design customizations, some are worried that the new requirement will limit creativity and innovation that might spring up from different solutions.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock">@justintadlock</a> Big change.  I'm pro customizer but not allowing it means better solutions may not see the light of day or even be attempted.</p>

<p></p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock">@justintadlock</a> It's better than most as far as WP goes today. I'd just hate to see it stifle other ways of tackling the customizer concept.</p>
<p>&mdash; Carl Hancock (@carlhancock) <a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock/status/590614883525341185">April 21, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/simplerain" target="_blank">Dovy Paukstys</a>, lead developer of the Redux Framework, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/04/21/this-weeks-meeting-important-information-regarding-theme-options/#comment-41129" target="_blank">commented</a> on the announcement to express a common concern among developers who utilize more specialized controls than the customizer can currently provide.</p>
<blockquote><p>So essentially what you‚Äôre mandating is for Frameworks, like Redux, to port all of their special controls to the Customizer because if a theme uses any form of a custom control and doesn&#8217;t display it in the customizer, in 6 months time you will boot from WP.org. Correct?</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that seem a little narrow sighted? The customizer is great for live reload, but it doesn&#8217;t have the real-estate for advanced fields that developers make.</p></blockquote>
<p>Resistance to the new guideline is frequently met with the suggestion that developers instead work on improving the customizer to be better for all users, as it is now WordPress&#8217; core-supported method of providing theme options. Paukstys finds it to be too limited in its current state for anything other than simple style changes.</p>
<blockquote><p>My personal motivation to improve the customizer is low since I personally do not see it as a viable option outside of styling. There‚Äôs simply not enough real-estate from a design perspective. It also doesn‚Äôt have things like visual validation, warnings, etc. It doesn‚Äôt offer field visibility linking, etc. It serves a powerful purpose, but I do not feel it is a complete replacement for the settings API.</p></blockquote>
<p>Paukstys further contends that the community was not represented in the decision process that followed the official proposal and that the new mandate unfairly promotes a single, narrow approach.</p>
<blockquote><p>Why do you wish to limit developers so much? Isn‚Äôt the point of open source for people to make things in different ways and improve the whole? Why are you limiting your devs? Could it be that the customizer hasn&#8217;t had the adoption that you think it deserves? This just seems like a mandate by your team and not a desire of the community as a whole.</p></blockquote>
<p>According to Emil Uzelac, theme authors using Redux or another framework are still at liberty to use the <a href="http://tgmpluginactivation.com/" target="_blank">TGM Plugin Activation library</a> to notify users of a theme being ‚ÄúRedux-Ready,&#8221; for example, but will not be able to fully package those options as part of the theme submitted to WordPress.org.</p>
<p>Tadlock is currently preparing a more comprehensive reply to these concerns but maintains that he will always support more innovative ways of approaching customization, should a new solution surpass that of the customizer in the future.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/carlhancock">@carlhancock</a> I'll always fight to get something innovative pushed through even if it doesn't fit in the guidelines.</p>
<p>&mdash; Justin Tadlock (@justintadlock) <a href="https://twitter.com/justintadlock/status/590616882648109056">April 21, 2015</a></p></blockquote>
<p></p>
<p>The Theme Review guidelines have continued to evolve with WordPress over the years and the team meetings are open to all who wish to have a voice in the decision-making process.</p>
<p>Tadlock is aiming to produce more education for theme authors within a day or two. He has also committed to helping developers build controls that are not readily available.</p>
<blockquote><p>Make me a list of controls you‚Äôd like to see. Core added a lot more options in 4.0, but I‚Äôm open to building any control classes that could be utilized by theme authors. If there‚Äôs a control that the customizer doesn‚Äôt support out of the box, it should be built by extending the core <code>WP_Customize_Control</code> class. I‚Äôll at least attempt to build any controls that people need help with.</p></blockquote>
<p>Theme developers who are worried about working with a limited set of customizer options will have help from the Theme Review Team. Those with themes that need updating have a six-month head start before the guidelines will be enforced on themes that submit an update.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 22 Apr 2015 21:00:18 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The new requirement will be phased in over 6 months, which gives existing theme authors some time to make the updates and new theme authors some time to adjust themes that might already be in progress.</p>
<p>This is a huge change. Although the Customizer has been available since WordPress 3.4 &#8212; which was released in June of 2012 &#8212; adoption has been slow on themes submitted to the official WordPress theme repository.</p>
<p>Official stats aren&#8217;t available, but of the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?priority=new+theme&status=new&priority=previously+reviewed&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=status&col=time&col=changetime&col=reporter&report=2&order=time">ten most recent themes</a> submitted to the theme repo I looked at, 20% had a custom options page. Of the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?priority=theme+update&status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=reporter&col=owner&col=time&col=changetime&report=1&order=time">ten most recent updates</a>, 40% had a custom options page. This is a very small sample, but there&#8217;s no doubt this change will effect a huge amount of submissions.</p>
<p>From a theme review perspective this makes a lot of sense. Verifying proper sanitization and proper use of the Settings API can take a huge amount of time for reviewers.</p>
<p>Many theme authors use frameworks like the Options Framework, Redux, Titan, Options Tree, and UpThemes &#8212; but reviewers still need to check for potentially malicious alterations, proper text domains, and function prefixing. Standardizing this by requiring the Customizer will make the job of theme review simpler.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> Echoing others, it's a win for users and will speed up review times. I think the time has come.</p>

<p></p>
<p>From a user interface¬†perspective, it also seems like a good move. Users can always expect options to be available in the Customizer tab if they exist and they won&#8217;t need to navigate unfamiliar custom screen layouts &#8212; though users of specific themes might be confused when the options page disappears on an update and moves into the Customizer bar.</p>
<p>For theme authors it is probably a mixed bag. Many authors rely on WordPress.org to drive sales of commercial theme upsells, and the theme options page is¬†a common place to promote such upsells. It can also take quite a bit of time to migrate options from a custom page to the Customizer and ensure perfect backwards compatibility.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/devinsays">@devinsays</a> I think it‚Äôs a great way to standardize and will ultimately be easier for both users and theme authors.</p>

<p></p>
<p>Certain frameworks also provide features that aren&#8217;t native to the Customizer, like repeater fields, multiselect, image radio buttons, datepickers, editor instances, and custom typography options &#8212; though Customizer libraries like <a href="http://kirki.org/">Kirki</a> can also bridge those gaps.</p>
<p>The Customizer has evolved quite a bit since it was first introduced. WordPress 4.0 brought a number of enhancements like contextual controls, panels and additional field types. Core features like custom headers, custom backgrounds and widget editing have migrated to the Customizer and then been improved over successive releases. In the upcoming WordPress 4.2 release users will be able to switch themes directly from the Customizer.</p>
<p>It could be argued that space constraints in the Customizer could make organization a bit more difficult for themes that ship with hundreds of different options, but there are many examples of WordPress themes already handling this well.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/make/">Make theme</a> by the Theme Foundry is one such example. It has six custom panels and over three hundred individual customization options &#8212; but is still a very usable and popular product. Obox¬†<a title="Layers, by Obox, introduces a beautiful page building interface" href="https://poststatus.com/layers-theme-obox/">also went all in</a> on the Customizer with their Layers page builder theme. Examples like these help prove that the Customizer can scale fairly well, even with¬†a lot of options.</p>
<p>Personally, I think the standardization of options is a great move forward. I originally started developing the <a href="http://wptheming.com/options-framework-theme/">Options Framework</a> (an easy way for developers to build custom options pages) over five years ago because there was not a good solution in core. I&#8217;m now happy to report that the code I helped develop is nearly obsolete as better tools have become available.</p>

Sellers should review their code and <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/">follow the guidelines</a> published on the Make WordPress plugins site.</p>
<p>While auditing the TGM Plugin Activation class, a XSS vulnerability was discovered. The TGM Plugin Activation class has since been updated despite the version number not being changed. If you&#8217;re a seller and use this class, you&#8217;ll need to update to the latest version of TGM Plugin Activation and update your item to include the latest version.</p>
<h2>OptionTree</h2>
<p>If you use <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-tree/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/option-tree/">OptionTree</a>, the marketplace review team is confident that all instances of <strong>add_query_arg</strong> and <strong>remove_query_arg</strong> have been escaped properly. There will be an update in the future that escapes these functions you should include in your item, but you shouldn&#8217;t delay updating your items while waiting for the update.</p>
<h2>Redux Framework</h2>
<p>The <a title="http://reduxframework.com/" href="http://reduxframework.com/">Redux framework</a> also uses <strong>add_query_arg</strong> and <strong>remove_query_arg</strong>, but most are escaped appropriately. There are a few questionable areas within the theme that the review team will provide updates on once they receive clarification.</p>
<h2>Theme Authors</h2>
<p>Theme authors who have bundled affected third-party plugins will be contacted by Envato in the next few days to update your theme. You&#8217;re encouraged to check bundled plugins before this time to see if they&#8217;re affected.</p>
<h2>Buyers</h2>
<p>According to Cronin, all WordPress specific items are being evaluated. Once the evaluation is complete, buyers who purchased an affected item will be notified. There&#8217;s no time frame on when the evaluation will be completed, however, Cronin says it is a priority and progress reports will be published in this <a title="http://codecanyon.net/forums/thread/security-vulnerability-affecting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/173013" href="http://codecanyon.net/forums/thread/security-vulnerability-affecting-wordpress-plugins-and-themes/173013">forum thread</a>.</p>
<h2>All Hands on Deck</h2>
<p>Cronin says, &#8220;When submitting an update that addresses these issues, please include a note mentioning it&#8217;s related to the <a title="http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-affects-more-than-a-dozen-popular-wordpress-plugins" href="http://wptavern.com/xss-vulnerability-affects-more-than-a-dozen-popular-wordpress-plugins">XSS vulnerability</a>. This will allow us to prioritize the review of updates.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unlike the WordPress.org plugin directory, Themeforest and CodeCanyon only provide and notify buyers of updates if they register with the update system. It&#8217;s not an optimal upgrade routine and one that requires buyers to opt-in instead of opt-out.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that sellers on Envato&#8217;s marketplaces do their part to check and patch any XSS vulnerabilities discovered. It&#8217;s also important the lines of communication remain open between the marketplaces and buyers so they can update purchased items as soon as possible. If you do business with Themeforest or CodeCanyon, be on the lookout for updates to items you&#8217;ve purchased.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:42:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The official <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/facebook/" target="_blank">Facebook plugin for WordPress</a> launched in 2012 with the help of engineers from Automattic and currently lists 14 contributing authors. The plugin is active on more than 200,000 websites, but Facebook has not updated the plugin description page to let users know that it has been <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-is-not-your-enemy-facebook-so-update-and-support-your-plugin" target="_blank">abandoned</a>.</p>
<p>The Facebook plugin has received no updates since March 2014, and support questions have gone unanswered for approximately a year. The plugin&#8217;s star ratings have plummeted to 2.2 out of 5.</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/facebook-plugin-forums.jpg" rel="prettyphoto[42519]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/facebook-plugin-forums.jpg?resize=775%2C409" alt="facebook-plugin-forums" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42551" /></a></p>
<p>The official word on the plugin is that Facebook has abandoned it and it is now <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/wordpress" target="_blank">supported by the community</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Facebook for WordPress was an officially supported tool to help WordPress developers integrate Social Plugins and publish Open Graph stories.</p>
<p>The plugin is no longer officially supported by Facebook but is maintained by the developer community.</p></blockquote>
<p>WordPress.com VIP still uses the plugin and has it listed among its <a href="https://vip.wordpress.com/plugins/" target="_blank">plugins and partners</a> but has developed a version tailored to VIP customers. If the plugin is similar enough to the official one listed on WordPress.org, it would be helpful to have some of the changes ported back to the community version.</p>
<p>I spoke with Sara Rosso from the VIP team to inquire about Automattic&#8217;s plans for the Facebook plugin. Automattic&#8217;s official response indicates that they will not be part of the community support effort:</p>
<blockquote><p>We&#8217;re currently supporting the Facebook plugin for use on the WordPress.com VIP platform, and we&#8217;ve made some modifications to it to work with our infrastructure. Automattic was a contributor to the initial version of the plugin (we provided some consultation and support), but there aren&#8217;t any plans to officially adopt ongoing development of the plugin as of today.</p></blockquote>
<p>The plugin provides a complex assortment of features that utilize Facebook&#8217;s ever-changing APIs. As such, it&#8217;s not easy to support and requires regular updates to keep it current with changes at Facebook. The one-year old version is now riddled with bugs.</p>
<p>Until a new maintainer steps up to adopt the plugin, WordPress users have no choice but to use <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/search.php?q=facebook" target="_blank">alternative community plugins</a>, which are linked on the documentation for the official plugin on Facebook.com.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 20:00:49 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

I was going to write a review, and still will, but ended up writing a bunch on the process of buying things from Apple as a loyal customer.</p>
<p>I have done the second-market Craigslist dance¬†with probably 90% of new Apple tablets and phones before, but never for a laptop. I&#8217;m sure every ounce of effort has been expended to capitalize on the hype of the announcements and ship as many of these as possible, but this Macbook/Watch roll-out still seems especially rough with the stores having zero inventory or knowledge of if/when they&#8217;re getting anything in, and ship dates now slipping into the summer. There&#8217;s a deeper issue though: it¬†speaks to a lack of Apple&#8217;s knowledge and connection to their customers, even though they have all the data.</p>
<p>A <a href="http://elevenmadisonpark.com/">great restaurant</a> will <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Setting-Table-Transforming-Hospitality-Business/dp/0060742763">track every time you&#8217;ve eaten there, how much you spent, your preferences</a>, and use that to prioritize reservations and tailor service on subsequent visits. Airlines, for their terrible reputation, actually are decent at this too¬†with their loyalty programs. On United I&#8217;m a <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887323423804579025120455867410">Global Services level flyer</a> and get some really nice perks as a result, with the knowledge that if I don&#8217;t fly a certain amount of miles and spend a certain amount of dollars with them in a calendar year I&#8217;ll lose those perks (as I did for a few months earlier this year) and so when choosing between two flights to somewhere I&#8217;m more likely to pick the United one. (Also I think <em>some</em> of airlines bad rep is undeserved, they are flying human beings miles in the air inside tin cans where the cost of an error is catastrophic, everything is highly regulated, and many service factors are literally dependent on the weather.)</p>
<p>I am an unapologetic, unrepentant Apple customer ever since I could afford it. One of the first things I did when I got my job at CNET in 2005 was upgrade my Mom from the inexpensive Linux box I built for her (all I could afford) to a Mac Mini. I get almost every new version of everything, including usually 4-6 phones a year (myself and family), at least a dozen laptops, iPads, Thunderbolt displays, iMacs, Mac Pros&#8230; at this point I&#8217;m probably a cumulative $100k customer of Apple, in addition to the millions we spend on Apple hardware at <a href="http://automattic.com/">Automattic</a>¬†(everyone gets a new computer when they join, and we refresh them every 18-24 months, and <a href="https://matt.wordpress.com/2013/03/24/new-laptop-sticker/">a special W version at after 4 years of tenure</a>). And I&#8217;m late to the game! There are Apple customers today who bought their first product <em>decades</em> ago.</p>
<p>However when pre-orders creak open at midnight, or people start queueing, the order of access to the latest and greatest from Apple is by whoever shows up first, or now online it&#8217;s essentially random depending on how lucky you are to load and complete the checkout process. In some ways there&#8217;s a beautiful equality to that, but for example when I went <a href="https://matt.wordpress.com/2013/09/20/huge-line-at-the-samsung-store-this-morning/">with Om in London for the 2013 iPhone release</a>, 95% of the line was people just there to buy and flip it, either locally or ship overseas &#8212; the very front of the line was Apple lovers, but in the rest of the line I saw people using Android.</p>
<p>There is some sort of rank ordering inside Apple &#8212; <a href="http://9to5mac.com/community/karl-lagerfeld-has-an-apple-watch-w-gold-link-bracelet/">Karl Lagerfied</a> and <a href="http://9to5mac.com/2015/04/20/beyonce-exclusive-apple-watch-gold-link-bracelet/">Beyonce have Apple Watches</a> already, reviewers from <a href="http://daringfireball.net/">Gruber</a> to <a href="http://davidpogue.com/">Pogue</a> get devices a few weeks early to test &#8212; <strong>but imagine if there was an Apple Loyalty program for the rest of us?</strong> More than almost any other company Apple has been sustained through tough times by the belief and devotion of their best customers. It would be great if you could earn status with monetary (dollars spent) and non-monetary (impact on the world) points that give you priority ordering access, faster Genius bar appointments, maybe even access to events.</p>
<p>Maybe the¬†truth is Apple doesn&#8217;t need to do that, I&#8217;m going to keep using them because they make the best products, and when things are rough in the early days (like with the new Macbook, a few recent versions of OS X and iOS) I stick it out because I know it&#8217;ll get better. To my knowledge no other tech product maker¬†has done a great loyalty program¬†before, though there are hints in Asian players like <a href="http://www.mi.com/en/">Xiaomi</a> and <a href="https://oneplus.net/">OnePlus</a>. Most luxury brands from <a href="http://www.hermes.com/">Hermes</a> to <a href="https://www.patek.com/en/home">Patek</a> are also bad at this, because they don&#8217;t understand technology and data. But how cool would it be if Apple¬†did reward, or even just recognize, their most loyal customers?</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 17:55:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Since its release less than a week ago, the theme has already been downloaded more than 1400 times. It&#8217;s easy to see why it&#8217;s an instant hit &#8211; the versatile design is perfect for writers, businesses, or personal sites.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gateway.png" rel="prettyphoto[42501]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gateway.png?resize=880%2C660" alt="gateway" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42522" /></a></p>
<p>The homepage design for Gateway includes a full-width header background image, a spot for featured posts, and a featured video. All of the theme options can be found in the customizer, including logo upload, accent color and background settings.</p>
<p>Gateway includes a custom page template for the home page as well as a full-width template. 404 pages also have a unique design. The theme includes support for one primary navigation menu and four optional widget areas.</p>

<h4>Support for Jetpack Users</h4>
<p>Gateway has built-in support for nine different Jetpack features, including contact form, infinite scrolling, post sharing, related posts, site icon, shortcode embeds, carousel, and tiled galleries. If you use any of these features on your site, the theme&#8217;s design will integrate theme seamlessly.</p>
<p>Check out a <a href="http://demo.rescuethemes.com/gateway/" target="_blank">live demo</a> to see Gateway in action with all of the supported Jetpack features activated.</p>
<p>Gateway is <a href="https://rescuethemes.com/" target="_blank">Rescue Themes</a>&#8216; debut on WordPress.org. The theme and plugin shop was founded by <a href="http://jamigibbs.com/" target="_blank">Jami Gibbs</a> in May of 2014. Rescue Themes builds products that are specialized for niches and organizations with a particular focus on humanitarian efforts.</p>
<p>Gateway was created using <a href="http://underscores.me/" target="_blank">Underscores</a>, Devin Price&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/customizer-library" target="_blank">Customizer Library</a>, and Zurb&#8217;s <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/" target="_blank">Foundation Framework</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;I find Foundation to be easier to selectively include components, keeping the theme lean,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;I also like the different grid options available, centering columns, offsets, etc. Last but not least, it&#8217;s developed in Sass.&#8221;</p>
<p>Rescue Themes&#8217; primary avenue of distribution is currently through <a href="http://themeforest.net/user/RescueThemes/portfolio" target="_blank">Themeforest</a>. Gibbs is one of a handful of WordPress theme authors who are trying to make a difference by selling themes that conform to WordPress.org Theme Review standards.</p>
<p>&#8220;I know Themeforest hasn&#8217;t always been the greatest place to find quality products,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A few of us are trying though.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think a lot of theme devs <em>think</em> they‚Äôve always developed to WP standards and I was among that crowd until I enlisted the help of Emil and Justin‚Äôs <a href="http://themereview.co" target="_blank">Themereview.co</a> for the <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/merch-a-woocommerce-wordpress-theme/full_screen_preview/10277209" target="_blank">Merch</a>, which I released earlier in the year,&#8221; Gibbs said. &#8220;Since then, I‚Äôve release another premium theme, <a href="http://themeforest.net/item/brewery-a-wordpress-theme-for-beer-makers/full_screen_preview/10941216" target="_blank">Brewery</a>, and now Gateway &#8211; all built with those standards in mind.&#8221;</p>
<p>To reinforce her knowledge of best practices, Gibbs also volunteers as a reviewer on the WordPress.org Theme Review team. The rigorous process of getting her theme approved took months, but she finds it to be worthwhile both for brand exposure and for giving back to the community.</p>
<p>So far <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/gateway/" target="_blank">Gateway</a> has been successful at attracting downloads on WordPress.org, and Gibbs plans to release more free themes as time allows. If you want to use the theme and need help getting started, you&#8217;ll find solid <a href="http://rescuethemes.com/documentation/gateway/" target="_blank">documentation</a> and <a href="https://rescuethemes.com/gateway-wordpress-theme/" target="_blank">demo content</a> available for Gateway on the Rescue Themes website.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 21 Apr 2015 16:35:06 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/seville-spain-to-host-wordcamp-europe-2015" target="_blank">WordCamp Europe 2015</a> will be held at the end of June in Seville, Spain, but organizers are already finalizing host city applications for the 2016 event. A <a href="http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-applications-to-organise-wordcamp-europe-2016-closes-in-5-days/" target="_blank">final call</a> for host cities went out today and organizers announced that applications will close on Friday, April 24.</p>
<p>This highly anticipated WordPress event is expected to bring in roughly 1,000 attendees from around the world. Such a massive undertaking requires a revolving planning process that prepares for the next year&#8217;s event while simultaneously planning the current year.</p>
<p>Organizers for 2016 will be required to attend and assist in organizing the 2015 event as part of the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordcamp-europe-now-taking-applications-for-2016-host-city" target="_blank">new organizer mentoring program</a> the team is piloting this year. Candidates must demonstrate excellent communication skills and become a reliable point of contact before being selected to the learn the ropes for the 2016 event.</p>
<p>&#8220;We think it&#8217;s important for next year&#8217;s team to get involved in this year&#8217;s organization,&#8221; co-organizer Petya Raykovska said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why we started early and one of the requirements for the applying teams is to be available to join the team in Seville if chosen.&#8221;</p>
<p>WordPress representatives in cities vying for the chance to host WCEU 2016 are required to complete a budget for each proposed venue and a detailed application form, which includes a team member summary, transportation and hotel information, and several other aspects of the event.</p>
<p>&#8220;Compiling the application takes time and it&#8217;s understandable they&#8217;ll all come in the last week,&#8221; Raykovska said. She and other members of the organization team have been in contact with several local WordPress communities that will be applying, as the prospect can be somewhat daunting given the level of detail required.</p>
<p>&#8220;Some teams need a bit of a nudge to feel confident enough to apply, even if they&#8217;ve done exceptional work organizing their local events,&#8221; she said.</p>
<p>The host city for WCEU 2016 will be selected by mid-May, which will give the new organizers enough time to get involved in the most active and important stages of the 2015 event. A sample budget and application form are <a href="http://europe.wordcamp.org/2015/call-for-applications-to-organise-wordcamp-europe-2016-closes-in-5-days/" target="_blank">available on the WordCamp Europe website</a>.

<p>Open source software makes up the vast majority of licensed code hosted on <a href="https://github.com" target="_blank">GitHub</a>, as one of the primary features of the site is code sharing and collaboration. In of April 2015, GitHub reported <a href="https://github.com/about/press" target="_blank">9.2 million users collaborating across 21.8 million repositories</a>. For the past seven years since the site&#8217;s launch, one of the most difficult challenges has been getting users to add a license to their projects.</p>
<p>Recent <a href="https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com" target="_blank">open source license usage stats</a> show MIT, GPL, and Apache licenses coming in as the most popular choices with 44.69%, 12.96%, and 11.19% respectively. However, GitHub&#8217;s reckoning shows that licensing numbers are still very low and continue to drop. Only 20% of unforked repositories on the site are currently licensed (30% if you count forked repositories.)</p>
<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/percentage-of-github-repositories-licensed.png" rel="prettyphoto[42389]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/percentage-of-github-repositories-licensed.png?resize=762%2C445" alt="credit: GitHub.com" class="size-full wp-image-42417" /></a>credit: <a href="https://github.com/blog/1964-open-source-license-usage-on-github-com">GitHub.com</a>
<p>Last month GitHub launched its <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/licenses/" target="_blank">Licenses API</a> in order to combat the continual decline in licensing numbers. &#8220;We want to make it easier for open source developers to license their code, and for open source consumers to verify that they are using open source projects under an appropriate license,&#8221; the announcement said.</p>
<p>The new Licenses API returns metadata about popular open source licenses and can detect a project&#8217;s license from the repository&#8217;s <code>LICENSE</code> file. Developers are welcome to preview the API while it&#8217;s still under development. Ultimately, GitHub is aiming to use the API to collect and provide more information about the open source licenses in use on the site, as well as the projects that are using them.</p>
<p>When a project doesn&#8217;t possess a license, it&#8217;s difficult for others to know what their freedoms and limitations are for reproducing, distributing, and modifying the code. Many companies have very strict licensing requirements when it comes to the code they choose to include in their projects.</p>
<p>In an effort to encourage users to add a license to their projects, GitHub created a handy tool called <a href="http://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank">ChooseALicense.com</a> that helps users select from the more popular open source licenses. The site uses plain language to make it easy to understand what is required, permitted, and forbidden for each license:</p>
<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gpl3-license-info-github.png" rel="prettyphoto[42389]"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/gpl3-license-info-github.png?resize=923%2C161" alt="gpl3-license-info-github" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42450" /></a></p>
<p>Repositories with licenses had bottomed out at around 15% on GitHub shortly before it <a href="https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license" target="_blank">launched the license picker tool</a>. The sharp increase in licensing in 2013 in the graph above can be attributed to <a href="http://choosealicense.com/" target="_blank">ChooseALicense.com</a>. Unfortunately, over the past two years the number of licensed repositories began to decline again.</p>
<p>Adding a license to your project is fundamental to sharing your code and empowering others to use it. Open source developers with struggling projects often complain about a lack of contribution. One of the most important things you can do to help your project get a good start is to carefully select an open source license that will be well-suited to the community you&#8217;re trying to build.</p>
<p>GitHub is aiming to provide more in-depth analysis in the coming weeks using data from the new Licenses API, and also plans to publish how license usage affects project success. If you&#8217;re struggling to select a license for a project that you maintain, check out GitHub&#8217;s <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/open-source-licensing/" target="_blank">Guide to Open Source Licensing</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 20 Apr 2015 20:33:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

The vulnerability stems from the improper use of the <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg"><i>add_query_arg()</i></a> and <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg"><i>remove_query_arg()</i></a> functions. Inaccurate information within the WordPress Codex lead many developers to assume these functions would properly escape user input.</p>
<p>The Codex pages were created in 2009, but earlier this year, Samuel &#8216;Otto&#8217; Wood updated both pages to include information on using esc_url(). Inaccurate information has existed on both pages for more than five years, leading hundreds, if not thousands, of developers to use insecure code in plugins.</p>

<p>The vulnerability was <a title="https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/" href="https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/">first reported by Joost de Valk</a> who has an excellent post describing the issue.

<p>With over <a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/">37,000 plugins in the directory</a>, 400 is just scratching the surface. Gary Pendergast, who is helping to manage the coordinated effort says, he doesn&#8217;t have an official headcount of the number of plugins affected. &#8220;There is no official head count on how many plugins are affected, as it‚Äôs a case-by-case thing to check.&#8221; Some of the vulnerable plugins within the list have opted-out of automatic updates. &#8220;Jetpack, EDD, P3, Download Monitor and Related Posts for WP opted-in to auto updates. I didn‚Äôt keep track of who opted out,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>So far, there is no evidence that suggests the vulnerability is being actively exploited. It&#8217;s extremely important that plugin authors revisit your code to make sure you&#8217;re not improperly using the <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg"><i>add_query_arg()</i></a> and <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg"><i>remove_query_arg()</i></a> functions. The Make WordPress Plugins site <a title="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/" href="https://make.wordpress.org/plugins/2015/04/20/fixing-add_query_arg-and-remove_query_arg-usage/">has a post</a> that provides in-depth information on how to check and fix your plugins.</p>
<h2>This Vulnerability is Not New</h2>
<p>Mike Jolley, lead developer for <a title="http://www.woothemes.com/" href="http://www.woothemes.com/">WooThemes</a>, published a post in 2013 on the use of <a title="http://mikejolley.com/2013/12/use-wordpress-url-manipulation-functions/" href="http://mikejolley.com/2013/12/use-wordpress-url-manipulation-functions/">WordPress&#8217; URL manipulation functions</a>. The post features <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/add_query_arg"><i>add_query_arg()</i></a> and <a title="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg" href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/remove_query_arg"><i>remove_query_arg()</i></a>, but near the end of the post, Jolley reminds developers to escape everything.</p>
<blockquote><p>This caught me out a few weeks ago when I found out (the hard way) that WordPress doesn‚Äôt automatically sanitize the current URL if you don‚Äôt pass in your own. You need to use esc_url during output:</p>
<p>echo esc_url( add_query_arg( $key, $value ) );</p>
<p>If you forget to do this, a malicious URL, for example one containing some JavaScript, could potentially be output and executed on your page. Escape all the things to be safe!</p></blockquote>
<h2>Battle Testing the Automatic Updater</h2>
<p>To date, this is the largest coordinated effort between an outside party, the WordPress core and security teams, and plugin developers. According to Sucuri, affected plugin developers banded together for the common good. Pendergast confirmed that the auto updates only contain code needed to fix the security vulnerability. This should limit the possibility of auto updates breaking sites.</p>

<p>It appears it was a common misunderstanding that the functions needed additional escaping when in use, and the WordPress Codex documentation for the functions did not show proper escaping in the example use cases for several years.</p>
<p>The exact number of plugins affected is unknown, but a number of <a title="The most popular WordPress plugins" href="https://poststatus.com/popular-wordpress-plugins/">the most popular WordPress plugins</a> are affected.</p>
<p>The vulnerability was originally disclosed to the team at Yoast by Johannes Schmitt of Scrutinizer CI. Joost de Valk took the issue to their security partner, Sucuri, and together they understood that the issue could affect far more than plugins than WordPress SEO and Google Analytics by Yoast.</p>
<p>They worked with WordPress lead developer and WordPress.org plugin team member Dion Hulse to evaluate how many other top plugins may be vulnerable. Combined, Joost <a href="https://yoast.com/coordinated-security-release/">notes in his security notice¬†post</a> that 44 people joined a dedicated WordPress Slack channel to work on the updates, which resulted in the coordinated release.</p>
<h3>Millions of websites affected</h3>
<p>Millions of websites are vulnerable due to this issue. Jetpack and Yoast&#8217;s WordPress SEO alone are active on well over a million websites.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.sucuri.net/2015/04/security-advisory-xss-vulnerability-affecting-multiple-wordpress-plugins">Sucuri has identified</a> a minimum of fifteen plugins affected, but they note they&#8217;ve only looked into the top &#8220;300-400&#8243; and others that were notable.</p>
<p>In all likelihood, many more plugins than those listed will have similar vulnerabilities. <code>add_query_arg()</code> and <code>remove_query_arg()</code> are relatively common functions in advanced WordPress development.</p>
<h3>Not always a high risk vulnerability</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to speak for exactly how high risk the mis-use of the functions could be, as they are used in different ways in different plugins; and even within a certain plugin codebase, they could be used many times and have different risk levels in each instance.</p>
<p>Escaping is a fundamental development principal. One of my favorite coffee mugs (pictured above) is from WordPress.com VIP and says, &#8220;Sanitize early, escape late, and drink often.&#8221;</p>
<p>It is therefore concerning that there was such broad misuse of a WordPress function for so long, and it went unchecked in the Codex.</p>
<p>The Codex previously had examples without escaping,¬†and it had no indication whether the return value was escaped or not. It simply stated that the return value as, &#8220;New URL query string.&#8221;</p>
<p>This has been updated, both in the examples and the return value section, to note that it can potentially return unescaped data.</p>
<blockquote><p>New URL query string. Note that this string may contain unescaped data not intended for a URL, especially if the data added comes from user input. The result should be passed through esc_url() before being output as HTML, in a link.</p></blockquote>
<p>That said, of the developers I&#8217;ve spoken to, even with the vulnerabilities in place they say that the risk of exploitation is small, due to the privileges required of users to attack. Though it is important to note that <em>that is no guarantee</em>, and it is important to update your¬†plugins if you have updates available.</p>
<p>The Codex is a wiki. It&#8217;s not a fundamental issue of WordPress that this was poorly documented, however it does point to some of the problems that have been noted for some time in regard to the value of the Codex. In fact, just this morning the Codex page for <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/add_query_arg/">add_query_arg()</a> was redirected to the new developer.wordpress.org page for the function instead.</p>
<p>Eventually, the Codex will go away for most functions that can point to the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.org">new developer reference</a>.</p>
<h3>Five plugins opting in to forced updates</h3>
<p>Jetpack, Easy Digital Downloads, P3 Plugin Profiler, Download Monitor, and Related Posts for WordPress are all opting in to automated forced updates from WordPress.org. This means that these plugins have created new releases for each major branch of their plugins to be distributed and automatically updated by the WordPress.org team.</p>
<p>Other plugins are not opting in. Notably, Yoast did not opt in for WordPress SEO or their Google Analytics plugin. Joost de Valk cites concerns that some site owners had their plugins deactivated during the <a href="https://yoast.com/wordpress-seo-security-release/">last forced upgrade process</a> they went through.</p>
<p>Indeed, my own site has had plugins deactivate when forced updated each time it&#8217;s occurred. I took this issue to members of the WordPress.org update team, and was told that they believe it is an edge case occurrence, and that while they are monitoring new updates, there is not currently a plan to change practices for the updates. I will be very interested with the updates today how commonly this happens.</p>
<h3>Other posts and resources</h3>
<p>I will continue to collect plugin update posts, changelogs, and other resources for this update. If you run a WordPress website, these updates will likely affect you.</p>
<p>There is no reason for panic or to be too concerned, but you should update your plugins as soon as you can to reduce your risk of vulnerability.</p>

<p><a href="http://belgrade.wordcamp.org/2015/" target="_blank">WordCamp Belgrade</a> will take place this weekend, April 18-19. Two years ago the WordPress community in Serbia was virtually non-existent but has <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-glimpse-into-serbias-rapidly-growing-wordpress-community" target="_blank">grown rapidly</a> and is now large enough to host the very first WordCamp in Belgrade. Registration kicks off at 8AM tomorrow morning where organizers will debut <a href="http://wptavern.com/meet-wapuujlo-official-mascot-of-wordcamp-belgrade" target="_blank">Wapuujlo</a>, the official mascot of the event.</p>
<p>WordCamp Belgrade features speakers from around Europe and 8/10 of the <a href="http://belgrade.wordcamp.org/2015/schedule/" target="_blank">presentations</a> will be in English. Topics include Building SaaS with WordPress, A/B testing and usability testing, Git Tricks, the WP REST API, and more.</p>

<p>This post was contributed by <a title="http://robertdall.com/" href="http://robertdall.com/">Robert Dall</a>. Studying web design in college, he stumbled upon WordPress.com early in his career. Dall made the natural progression from WordPress.com to the self-hosted version of WordPress. Since then, he&#8217;s worked almost exclusively with WordPress using it as a blog, CMS, portfolio, and¬†e-commerce. He&#8217;s also an avid photographer.</p>
<hr />
<p>Coming in WordPress 4.2 is something that has been¬†long overdue and something I have encountered as a former photographer working with WordPress. When you import a photo into WordPress that has IPTC data, the caption populates the description field and not the caption field.</p>
<p>This is mainly due to the fact that the <a title="Website of the IPTC and it's standards for photo metadata" href="https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/">IPTC</a> (International Press Telecommunications Council) calls the caption the description. When WordPress integrated all of the camera metadata¬†(also called EXIF meta data) and caption data, they mistakenly populated the caption field into the wrong field.</p>
<p>In <a title="http://ottopress.com/2011/picasa-and-wordpress-and-captions/" href="http://ottopress.com/2011/picasa-and-wordpress-and-captions/">this blog post</a>, Samuel ‚ÄúOtto‚Äù Wood points out the problem and created a plugin to address the issue. While this is a good fix for projects like the new <a title="Art Wolfe website" href="http://artwolfe.com/">Art Wolfe</a> website, I knew WordPress could be easier to use for photographers who use the IPTC data fields. Those who don‚Äôt wouldn&#8217;t notice a change.</p>
<h2>The Benefits of This Small Change</h2>
<p>I think media organizations that use WordPress and those that might in the future, will benefit from this industry standard being properly integrated into something that powers more than 20% of the internet.</p>
<p>Photography plugin developers such as <a title="WooCommerce Photography Plugin" href="http://www.woothemes.com/products/woocommerce-photography/" target="_blank">WooCommerce Photography,</a> could really benefit from this small change to core as similar plugins inherently use the built-in media uploader in WordPress. The problem is that it requires unit tests to be written and some changes to WordPress core, stuff that is well beyond my WordPress knowledge.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://artwolfe.com/">Art Wolfe</a> project has allowed me to work with a great WordPress developer named <a title="Sergey Biryukov" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/SergeyBiryukov" target="_blank">Sergey Biryukov</a>. I knew if I gathered enough interest in a patch, I could approach Biryukov with the idea that we might get this fix into WordPress and put a <a title="Use Exif description to autofill the caption" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/7580">seven-year-old trac ticket</a> to bed.</p>
<h2>What I Did to Get This Issue Fixed</h2>
<p>I didn‚Äôt write a lick of code, write the ticket, and no props are coming my way, nor should they. It was¬†<a title="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31694" href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/31694">Biryukov</a> who wrote the final patch and got it committed with props to <a title="https://profiles.wordpress.org/beaulebens" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/beaulebens">@beaulebens</a>, <a title="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ericlewis" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ericlewis">@ericlewis</a>, and <a title="https://profiles.wordpress.org/bendoh" href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/bendoh">@bendoh</a>.</p>
<p>I attended every core meeting until it was committed. Whenever there was an ‚Äúopen discussion‚Äù time during the meeting, I mentioned the ticket. I also let Drew Jaynes, 4.2 release lead and former photographer, know of my intentions. I tested the patch on a number of <a title="WordPress gallery plugins " href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/22768#comment:20">heavily used photography plugins</a> to see if there would be any adverse impact on them. Subsequently, I haven‚Äôt found any that were directly attributed to the patch.</p>
<p>Since I am mainly self-employed, I had the ability to lobby this ticket during what would be considered working hours and, like <a title="Rick Ashley Never gonna give you up gif" href="http://robertdall.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Never-gonna-give-you-up.gif" rel="prettyphoto[42322]">Rick Astley, ‚ÄúI was never going to give you up.‚Äù </a>So photographers rejoice! Caption information will be automatically imported into WordPress and your work flow of importing, editing, and captioning using the <a title="https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/" href="https://iptc.org/standards/photo-metadata/">IPTC standard</a> will be completely integrated into WordPress.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 23:30:24 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

For the past several months, core developer <a href="http://imathi.eu/" target="_blank">Mathieu Viet</a> (@imath) has been spearheading the effort to get the new Attachments API ready for 2.3 with the help of contributions and feedback from the core team.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/5429" target="_blank">Attachments API</a> is a new library that will allow developers to create components that have the ability to manage uploads. The first example of this API in action is a vastly improved core interface for uploading, cropping, and setting profile photos for users and groups. This new <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6290" target="_blank">extensible avatar UI</a> landed in BP trunk yesterday.</p>
<p>As you can see below, the new interface allows for the traditional image upload. It also adds the ability for users to access their device camera to capture a profile photo, if they are using a browser that supports <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=stream" target="_blank">getUserMedia</a>.</p>
<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/user-camera-capture.png" rel="prettyphoto[42306]"><img src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/user-camera-capture.png?resize=776%2C890" alt="user-camera-capture" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42330" /></a></p>
<p>Administrators can also easily edit a member&#8217;s profile photo from the extended profile screen in the admin.</p>
<p>For those who prefer the legacy interface, you can use a filter to disable the new UI. This allows you to still keep your BuddyPress core updated, even if you don&#8217;t want to add the new avatar interface to your community. Check out @imath&#8217;s <a href="https://bpdevel.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/a-good-way-to-shape-the-future-of-buddypress-attachments-is-to-take-care-of-avatars/" target="_blank">post</a> on the BuddyPress development blog for details on using the filter, as well as more information on the applicable templates and theme compatibility.</p>
<p>One of the most exciting things about the new avatar UI is that plugin developers can easily extend it for their own unique purposes.</p>
<p>&#8220;Regarding extensibility: In the long run, we want plugins to be able to add their own versions of the uploader, ideally with a minimal amount of work,&#8221; BP lead developer <a href="http://boone.gorg.es/" target="_blank">Boone Gorges</a> said in discussion on the <a href="https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6290" target="_blank">ticket</a>. &#8220;@imath has already demonstrated that it&#8217;s not too difficult, and in the future I imagine that we&#8217;ll discover ways to make it even easier.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gorges emphasized that the focus at the moment is to build a solid replacement for the avatar upload system in 2.3 and then work on continually improving the API over time.</p>

<p>In mid 2014, <a href="https://twitter.com/borekb">Borek Bernard</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/JanVoracek">Jan Vor√°ƒçek</a> from the Czech Republic, <a title="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses" href="http://wptavern.com/versionpress-hopes-to-bring-version-control-to-the-masses">launched a crowdfunding campaign</a> to fund the development of <a title="http://versionpress.net/" href="http://versionpress.net/">VersionPress</a>. VersionPress is a <strong>version control plugin</strong> for WordPress. It keeps the whole site in a Git repository enabling things like <strong>site-wide reverts, safe updates, </strong>and<strong> easy staging</strong>. Despite not reaching their funding goal, the team pressed on and <a title="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/04/versionpress-1-0-released/" href="http://blog.versionpress.net/2015/04/versionpress-1-0-released/">has released the first stable version</a> to early backers of the project.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been excited to try VersionPress ever since I learned about it last year. After downloading 1.0, I uploaded it to my test site hosted on BlueHost which is optimized for WordPress. When activated, it will go through a checklist to make sure the server meets the minimum requirements. The minimum requirements are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>PHP 5.3</li>
<li>Execute external commands</li>
<li>Git 1.9+ installed</li>
<li>Write access on the filesystem</li>
<li>db.php hook</li>
<li>Not multisite</li>
<li>Standard directory layout</li>
<li>.gitignore</li>
<li>.htaccess or web.config support</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately, I&#8217;m unable to use VersionPress on my hosting account because it doesn&#8217;t have Git 1.9+ installed. I contacted BlueHost to see if it can be installed on the server and it can&#8217;t. If I want to use Git, I&#8217;d have to upgrade to a VPS or Dedicated hosting plan.</p>
<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VersionPressNeedsGit2.png" rel="prettyphoto[42209]"><img class="size-full wp-image-42309" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/VersionPressNeedsGit2.png?resize=1025%2C512" alt="VersionPress Needs Git" /></a>VersionPress Needs Git
<p>If Git 1.9+ is not installed on a majority of shared webhosting servers, that&#8217;s a huge audience unable to use VersionPress. To be fair, functionally similar plugins such as <a title="https://revisr.io/" href="https://revisr.io/">Revisr</a> and <a title="http://www.presslabs.com/gitium/" href="http://www.presslabs.com/gitium/">Gitium</a> also require Git to be installed on the server. I asked Bernard why Git is needed to use the plugin, &#8220;To use Git was an important decision that enables all the nice things VersionPress provides but it also means that Git is required on the server, currently. In the future, we plan to relax this requirement but for version 1.0, Git is required,&#8221; Bernard said.</p>
<p>VersionPress is only available through the <a title="http://versionpress.net/#get" href="http://versionpress.net/#get">Early Access Program</a> which is a cross between early access, crowd-funding, and a standard support plan. The team plans on releasing a new version approximately every three months.</p>
<p>To say that I&#8217;m disappointed is an understatement. My excitement for VersionPress to be the undo button for WordPress is tempered due to not being able to use it on a live site. I could run Git on my local server, but I want to see how it works in a live environment. Although managed WordPress hosting has become a popular option, the majority of sites on the web use shared hosting.

<p>A product&#8217;s documentation is usually a strong indicator of its quality, but creating docs is often the least exciting aspect of launching something new. Products that lack documentation can create a greater support burden, forcing you to write docs as a defensive measure after the fact.</p>
<p>The free <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/documentation-post-type" target="_blank">Documentation Post Type</a> plugin may be just the push you need to get started writing docs without a lot of hassle. The plugin creates a custom post type for product documentation. The advantage of storing docs in a custom post type is that you&#8217;ll be able to easily organize, export, and maintain your documentation to be separate from your regular posts and pages.</p>
<p>The Documentation Post Type plugin features the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Registers a &#8220;documentation&#8221; post type</li>
<li>Registers a &#8220;documentation-category&#8221; taxonomy</li>
<li>Registers a &#8220;documentation-tag&#8221; taxonomy</li>
<li>Registers a &#8220;product-tag&#8221; taxonomy</li>
<li>Adds the post count to the admin dashboard</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://wptheming.com/" target="_blank">Devin Price</a>, owner of <a href="https://devpress.com/" target="_blank">DevPress</a>, created the plugin primarily for product documentation but encourages users to adapt it for any purpose. He created it based off of code from Gary Jones&#8217; <a href="https://github.com/GaryJones/Gamajo-Dashboard-Glancer" target="_blank">Dashboard Glancer</a> class and <a href="https://github.com/GaryJones/portfolio-post-type" target="_blank">Portfolio Post Type</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The project also includes a Gruntfile.js and package.json file, which Price added for building translation files (.pot). If this isn&#8217;t necessary for your project, you can remove them from the plugin package. If you need a quick way to start documenting your products, download the zip file or <a href="https://github.com/devinsays/documentation-post-type" target="_blank">fork the plugin on GitHub</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 17 Apr 2015 01:13:10 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>The <a href="https://array.is/" target="_blank">Array</a> theme shop, founded by Mike McAlister, is celebrating one year since becoming a completely independent operation. Array, formerly known as Okay Themes, <a href="http://wptavern.com/okay-themes-pulls-out-of-themeforest-rebrands-as-array" target="_blank">pulled out of Envato&#8217;s marketplace last April</a> to rebrand and relaunch with the freedom to further build the business.</p>
<p>At that time, McAlister said, ‚ÄúAfter fighting the good fight for five years, my body of work has officially outgrown the ThemeForest marketplace. Although it has been a great platform for starting my business, my own ethos and aspirations have evolved.‚Äù</p>
<p>In a surprise about-face, Array is returning to Themeforest with a selection of themes and selling as a non-exclusive author. McAlister considers this an expansion of their independent shop, which has experimented with a number of different distribution channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;The thing is, Themeforest dominates when it comes to market share,&#8221; he said in a recent <a href="https://array.is/a-year-in-review/" target="_blank">post</a> explaining the change. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">With all of the various avenues we tried, none came close to the reach or revenue that Themeforest has provided in years past.</span>&#8221;</p>
<p>McAlister <a href="https://wpchat.com/t/array-is-moving-back-onto-themeforest/789/3?u=pollyplummer" target="_blank">replied</a> to a thread on WP Chat to clarify that the decision was not motivated by a lack of sales or desire to cut back on Array. Rather, they see Themeforest as an opportunity to increase exposure to the brand, despite the fact that Array will now make just $19 per theme sale on the marketplace while still attempting to provide quality support.</p>
<p>&#8220;We‚Äôve definitely been selling more themes at the $49 price point in the short term, but we‚Äôre still quantifying that data to see if it‚Äôs where we want to be ultimately,&#8221; McAlister said.</p>
<h3>Drawbacks of Selling with WordPress.com and Creative Market</h3>
<p>Even more interesting than Array&#8217;s move back to Themeforest are the insights McAlister shared about selling via other marketplaces. After exploring multiple avenues of distribution during the past year, he found the most significant drawbacks came with <a href="https://creativemarket.com/" target="_blank">Creative Market</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.com/" target="_blank">WordPress.com</a>.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first few months of our time on Creative Market, we&#8217;ve only seen ~20 sales per month,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Although there is a ton of activity for other kinds of digital goods, the WordPress category simply doesn&#8217;t seem to be thriving.&#8221;</p>
<p>Array&#8217;s experience with WordPress.com was similarly disappointing, due to the company&#8217;s recent promotion of free themes in the past several months and lengthy wait times in the approval queue.</p>
<p>&#8220;The review process on WordPress.com is long,&#8221; McAlister said. &#8220;I‚Äôm not talking about weeks long, I‚Äôm talking about months long. Each Array theme review has taken at least a month, usually longer. Our latest theme for WP.com, Camera, took four months from the day I submitted it to the day it was released.&#8221;</p>
<p>While his experience may not represent that of all theme authors on WordPress.com, the structure of the selling process makes it difficult for authors to build a reliable source of income.</p>
<p>&#8220;At any rate, as you can imagine, releasing products this far apart makes it difficult to gain momentum, predict sales figures, and establish a reliable stream of income,&#8221; he said. &#8220;On top of that, because theme sales aren&#8217;t calculated until after the refund window has passed (understandably), it can be several months until you see return on a theme.&#8221;</p>
<p>McAlister&#8217;s disappointing experiences with Creative Market and WordPress.com contributed to his decision to move back to Themeforest. Although Array is currently bringing in double the monthly revenue it was making on Themeforest previously, the shop still relies on outside distribution channels.</p>
<p>&#8220;It would be super great if Array was suddenly wildly successful and we could just sell themes solely through the site and not rely on marketplaces, but that‚Äôs not the reality of the commercial theme world right now,&#8221; McAlister <a href="https://array.is/a-year-in-review/#comment-10012" target="_blank">said</a> in response to comments on his announcement.</p>
<p>No marketplace is perfect and each has its own unique drawbacks, but Array&#8217;s experiences this past year re-established Themeforest as the clear winner for the shop&#8217;s current needs.</p>
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, as <a href="http://philiparthurmoore.com/2015/02/26/themeforest/" target="_blank">poignantly stated</a> by Philip Moore recently, there exists no better or more accessible platform for developers to distribute commercial WordPress themes right now. WordPress.com isn&#8217;t accepting new partners, Creative Market doesn&#8217;t have a sustainable market for themes, and starting a new theme shop without an established following would be nothing more than an exercise in futility.</p></blockquote>
<p>McAlister hopes that Array can have a positive impact on the Themeforest marketplace, instead of remaining among those that criticize from the sidelines.</p>
<p>&#8220;Given that we spend a great deal of time crafting themes to high standards, in both form and function, we want to help further promote the idea of design-driven, feature-conscious themes, without sacrificing quality or selling your soul to the devil,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;We want to show people that you can, in fact, make a living creating honest products.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 22:12:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:37;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p>Cloudup for OSX 10.10 looks more modern and is fully compatible with Yosemite. The service has also made some architectural enhancements to improve scalability and security. Details of these improvements are not available, but the service plans to publish them at a later date.</p>
<p>I rarely visit the dashboard, but I appreciate these subtle changes. One thing I don&#8217;t like is having to click my avatar image to access the menu that contains account settings and other useful links. There&#8217;s nothing on the site that indicates this action is necessary. I think it should be a drop down menu to eliminate possible confusion. If not a drop down menu, then at least one text label next to my avatar image that when clicked, opens the menu.</p>

If you use iThemes Security, you&#8217;ll want to update as soon as possible to fix a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Easy Digital Downloads celebrated its third birthday. We discussed the impacts successful software can have on people&#8217;s lives. Marcus and I both agree that Pippin Williamson, founder of Easy Digital Downloads, sets the bar when it comes to being a role model in the WordPress ecosystem. I closed out the show with a rant on how media companies fail to recognize the distinct differences between Automattic, WordPress.com, and WordPress.org.</p>

<p>If you follow WordPress topics on Quora, you may have noticed a popular question making the rounds regarding security. The <a href="http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take" target="_blank">question</a> has been viewed more than 30,000 times:</p>
<blockquote><p>I am powering a bank&#8217;s website using WordPress. What security measures should I take?</p></blockquote>
<p>Ordinarily, such a question is a magnet for trollish responses and uninformed WordPress bashing. However, this time Quora users were delighted to find that Matt Mullenweg, co-creator of WordPress, dropped by to offer an <a href="http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take/answer/Matt-Mullenweg" target="_blank">answer</a> to the question.</p>
<p>Following a barrage of anti-WordPress remarks from other users, Mullenweg chimed in to clarify how WordPress can be used successfully in the banking industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>I agree there&#8217;s probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a bank&#8217;s website on WordPress, however there is no reason you couldn&#8217;t run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress, and in fact you&#8217;d be leveraging WordPress&#8217; strength as a content management platform that is flexible, customizable, and easy to update and maintain.</p></blockquote>
<p>He follows it up with two simple tips for keeping WordPress secure, including making sure the software is updated diligently, and using strong passwords for all user accounts. Mullenweg also solicited examples of WordPress-powered bank websites on his <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/04/a-bank-website-on-wordpress/" target="_blank">post</a> highlighting his Quora response, and several commenters provided links to their work.</p>
<p>WordPress is often singled out for security concerns, given its high profile and dominant CMS marketshare. The platform is also regularly the target of hackers looking to maximize the return on their efforts. According to Mullenweg, WordPress&#8217; security boils down to how you deploy it:</p>
<blockquote><p>As the most widely used CMS in the world, many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way, but the same could be said of Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node, Rails, Java, or any widely-used software. It is possible and actually not that hard to run WordPress in a way that is secure enough for a bank, government site, media site, or anything.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, the security of a WordPress-powered banking website depends entirely on whether or not its developers have the necessary security expertise to manage the technology in a responsible way.</p>
<p>Even with all of the negative reactions to the Quora question, the other answers are important to consider, as it offers a window into how people perceive WordPress. Battling negative perceptions about security is one of the biggest challenges facing the platform today.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://wptavern.com/fbi-warns-of-isil-defacement-attacks-on-wordpress-sites" target="_blank">recent rash of security vulnerabilities</a> popping up in some of WordPress&#8217; most popular plugins has exposed the need for better education on basic security measures, such as regularly updating your software. Hopefully, a few words of clarification from the project&#8217;s co-founder can go a long way towards building consumer confidence.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 16 Apr 2015 03:43:15 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:40;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

Williamson describes the last three years as containing some of the highest and lowest points of his life.</p>
<p>Williamson acknowledged that without his dedicated team, the product wouldn&#8217;t be anywhere close to what it is today. For example, when EDD was first released, it contained¬†8,085 lines of PHP. Today, EDD has¬†64,195 lines of PHP, which is nearly an 800%¬†increase.</p>
<p>He describes what it was like to discover the first severe security vulnerability in EDD that didn&#8217;t require special knowledge to exploit:</p>
<blockquote><p>On Valentine‚Äôs day, 2013, I was notified of a¬†critical security flaw in Easy Digital Downloads that made it possible for someone to gain full admin access to EDD sites that were running a specific configuration of settings in the plugin. Exploiting the flaw was trivial and required no special knowledge of typical exploit methods. With the click of a button, any unauthenticated visitor could become a full admin.</p>
<p>Realizing that flaw was out in the wild was¬†<strong>terrifying</strong>, and I hated myself for allowing it to happen. Suddenly I was faced with the very real possibility of being the person responsible for the compromise of a large number of sites. To say that I slept poorly that night would be a vast understatement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Besides the stats, growth, and personal experiences, the thing I find most impressive is the last part of the article where Williamson discusses the impact EDD has had on the lives of those who work on it.</p>
<blockquote><p>Of all reasons to be happy about earning more, the one I like the most is the excellent set of opportunities that open up. I‚Äôm not talking about expensive cars, luxury vacations, fancy houses or anything of that nature. No, I‚Äôm referring to the opportunities to change peoples lives.</p></blockquote>
<p>He shares the personal stories of Dan Griffiths, Chris Christoff, Sean Davis and others who are able to make a comfortable living thanks to the success of EDD.</p>
<p>Griffiths was homeless for five years before he started contributing to EDD. After creating a few successful extensions for the <a title="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/blog/author/ghost1227/" href="https://easydigitaldownloads.com/blog/author/ghost1227/">marketplace</a>, he found himself in a welcoming community that valued his ideas and contributions. Through his involvement with EDD, he was able to move off the streets, become an active contributor to the project, and regularly attend WordCamps.</p>
<p>I asked Williamson how long it took to come up with the words to describe the impact his product is having on people&#8217;s lives, <a title="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins/status/588438395279515650" href="https://twitter.com/pippinsplugins/status/588438395279515650">he responded</a>, &#8220;It took all day.&#8221; If I were in his position, I too would likely have a difficult time putting the impact into words.</p>
<p>All too often, I think we focus so much on the product that we forget about the impact it has on people&#8217;s lives. For Williamson and his team at EDD, the impact is well documented and celebrated.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 23:04:23 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

What security measures should I take?&#8221; The answers have mostly been ignorant junk along the lines of &#8220;Oh NOES WP is INSECURE! let me take my money out of that bank&#8221;, <a href="http://www.quora.com/I-am-powering-a-banks-website-using-WordPress-What-security-measures-should-I-take/answer/Matt-Mullenweg">so I wrote one myself</a>, which I&#8217;ve copied below.</p>
<blockquote><p>I agree there&#8217;s probably not a ton of benefit to having the online banking / billpay / etc portion of a bank&#8217;s website on WordPress, however there is no reason you couldn&#8217;t run the front-end and marketing side of the site on WordPress, and in fact you&#8217;d be leveraging WordPress&#8217; strength as a content management platform that is flexible, customizable, and easy to update and maintain.</p>
<p>In terms of security, there are a two simple points:</p>
<ol>
<li>Make sure you&#8217;re on the latest version of core and all the plugins you run, and update as soon as new version become available.</li>
<li>Use strong passwords for all user accounts. For extra credit you could enable a 2-factor plugin, use <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack&#8217;s WordPress.com¬†login system</a>, or restrict logged-in users to a certain IP range (like behind a VPN).</li>
</ol>
<p>If your host doesn&#8217;t handle it, make sure you stay up-to-date for everything in your stack as well from the OS on up. Most modern WP hosts handle this (and updates) for you, and of course you could always run your site on <a id="qlink_8whpnsgvws" class="qlink qtext_editor_link_text" href="http://vip.wordpress.com/">WordPress.com VIP</a>¬†alongside some of the top sites in the world. If you use any non-core third party code, no harm in having a security firm audit the source as well (an advantage of using open source).</p>
<p>For an example of a beautiful, responsive banking website built on WordPress, check out <a href="http://gcbaz.com/">Gateway Bank of Mesa AZ</a>. WordPress is also trusted to run sites for some of the largest and most security-conscious organizations in the world, including Facebook, SAP, Glenn Greenwald&#8217;s The Intercept, eBay, McAfee, Sophos, GNOME, Mozilla, MIT, Reuters, CNN, Google Ventures, NASA, and literally hundreds more.</p>
<p>As the most widely used CMS in the world, many people use and deploy the open source version of WordPress in a sub-optimal and insecure way, but the same could be said of Linux, Apache, MySQL, Node, Rails, Java, or any widely-used software. It is possible and actually not that hard to run WordPress in a way that is secure enough for a bank, government site, media site, or anything.</p>

<p>Last week WooCommerce announced that the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/" target="_blank">plugin</a> had <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/2015/04/woocommerce-7-million-downloads/" target="_blank">passed 7 million downloads</a> and the WordPress.org plugin directory reports that it is currently in use on over a million websites.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woothemes.com/woocommerce/" target="_blank">WooCommerce</a> is not only head of the pack when it comes to WordPress e-commerce solutions, the plugin is also the global leader among e-commerce platforms. According to recent stats from <a href="http://builtwith.com/" target="_blank">BuiltWith</a>, WooCommerce is currently powering roughly 30% of all online stores.</p>
<p><a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wc-percentages-620x571.png" rel="prettyphoto[42000]"><img src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/wc-percentages-620x571.png?resize=620%2C571" alt="wc-percentages-620x571" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-42150" /></a></p>
<h3>WooCommerce Accounts for 85% of Overall Sales at WooThemes</h3>
<p>WooThemes supports the product through the sale of <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/woocommerce-extensions/" target="_blank">extensions</a> and <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/product-category/themes/woocommerce/" target="_blank">themes</a> for WooCommerce. However, when <a href="http://wpcandy.com/reports/woothemes-forks-jigoshop-into-woocommerce/#.VS6gJ_nF_gg" target="_blank">WooThemes first forked Jigoshop</a> to create the plugin, they had no idea that it would become the staple of their business.</p>
<p>&#8220;We saw potential, but didn‚Äôt envision such a drastic change of direction for our overall business,&#8221; WooThemes co-founder <a href="http://jepson.no/" target="_blank">Magnus Jepson</a> told the Tavern. &#8220;When we initially had the idea for eCommerce for WordPress, our goal was to increase our revenue by selling more eCommerce themes.</p>
<p>&#8220;James and Mike, our two core WooCommerce developers, came up with the extension model for WooCommerce, which was the key success to turning WooCommerce into the revenue machine that it has become today, making up around 85% of our overall sales.&#8221;</p>
<p>Downloads of the core plugin are on the rise from 1 million in 2013, to 4 million in August 2014, and 7 million so far this year. WooCommerce currently has 339 free and commercial extensions listed in its official directory, which is the main revenue source driving support and continual development.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can‚Äôt disclose our exact income unfortunately, but we do process several million dollars per year,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Our revenue has been climbing steadily over the past few years, and we are regularly breaking monthly revenue records.&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the success of the plugin and the growth of its global community, WooThemes hosted the first <a href="http://wptavern.com/wooconf-the-first-ever-conference-dedicated-to-woocommerce-deemed-a-success" target="_blank">WooConf</a> in San Francisco last year. The conference was solely devoted to WooCommerce products and development.</p>
<p>&#8220;Our first WooConf was a huge hit, and exceeded all of our expectations,&#8221; Jepson said. &#8220;We had 320 participants join us for this amazing event, and we are planning on almost doubling the size of the second WooConf being held in Austin in November of this year.&#8221;</p>
<p>Global WooCommerce usage is on a steady upwards climb, and the WooThemes team plans to go after more partnerships this year.</p>
<p>&#8220;The future is big, and I see WooCommerce being the dominating eCommerce platform online, reaching more people through a larger distribution network (hosting providers and partners),&#8221; Jepson said. &#8220;Our goal for 2015 is &#8216;Strengthening Partnerships,&#8217; and I‚Äôm sure we&#8217;ll surprise quite a few people when they see our growth.&#8221;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 15 Apr 2015 17:55:31 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:43;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a title="https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-groups/" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/plugin-groups/">Plugin Groups</a> is a free new plugin by <a title="https://calderawp.com/" href="https://calderawp.com/">CalderaWP</a> that adds the ability to organize plugins by groups for easy filtering. For example, you can create a group called e-Commerce and add all plugins dealing with e-Commerce to the group. When you browse to the Plugins page, you&#8217;ll see a new filter at the top called e-Commerce. Clicking on it will display only the plugins within that group.</p>

<p>You can organize groups by clicking on a group&#8217;s name and dragging it up or down. One thing I noticed is that clicking the save button doesn&#8217;t appear to do anything, even though it saves the configuration. I recommend displaying a visual notification that tells me I clicked the save button and the configuration saved successfully.</p>
<p>I tested the plugin on WordPress 4.2 and it works as advertised. Plugin Groups is a nice way to organize and access plugins based on functionality. Plugin Groups should definitely come in handy for those who use 50 plugins or more.

The app now supports two-factor authentication without the need for application passwords. In the past, WordPress mobile apps required an extra step wherein you would generate a unique password for the app on each of your mobile devices. This release eliminates that extra requirement.</p>
<p>One of the most visible new features in 3.9 is the improved experience of adding media from your device to your site&#8217;s media library. Previously, adding media required a couple extra clicks to navigate to the correct screen for capturing a photo/video or selecting from the mobile device&#8217;s gallery.</p>
<p>The new media screen includes new buttons at the top that allow you to capture a photo or video with your device. It also displays all of your media sources from one location, a major improvement that makes adding media faster and more convenient.</p>
<p>Also new in 3.9 is a language selector specific to the app, which currently <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/blob/develop/tools/exported-language-codes.csv" target="_blank">supports 32 different languages</a> for publishing.</p>
<p>The release <a href="https://apps.wordpress.org/2015/04/14/wordpress-for-android-version-3-9/" target="_blank">post</a> credits 11 different people for their contributions to 3.9. Development for the <a href="https://github.com/wordpress-mobile/WordPress-Android/milestones/4.0" target="_blank">4.0 milestone</a> is already underway on GitHub.</p>
<p>Android users who are eager to update to the latest version may need to wait a few hours. According to contributor <a href="https://github.com/tonyr59h" target="_blank">Tony Rankin</a>, the update was moved to production today and can take awhile to fully propagate. Users can expect the 3.9 update to hit their devices within 24 hours.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 23:33:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"

<p><a href="http://wpsessions.com/" target="_blank">WPSessions</a> founder Brian Richards announced a radical shift in his pricing structure this week. The site was launched two years ago to provide developer education through videos that allow customers to learn from WordPress experts.</p>
<p>Live events are now 100% free for everyone to attend, and the price of the recorded sessions has been reduced from $30/each to $9.</p>
<p>&#8220;The changeup has come entirely from my struggles to get multiple speakers to present within the same small window of time,&#8221; Richards said. With a global audience of both presenters and customers, coordinating timezones often posed a roadblock to scheduling. Richards can now tell the presenters to pick a day and time that works for them and he will be there to record it. The changes also allow for a greater variety of topics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Rather than bundling three similar presentations under a single event, I can now have entirely different topics going on within the same month, or still keep the month focused to a single topic but have the presentations spread out over a couple of weeks,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>In the past, Richards struggled even to get paying customers to attend the live events, as they opted instead to watch the recorded sessions later.</p>
<p>&#8220;With the live broadcasts, having direct access to all of these presenters is a HUGE opportunity, so it was always disappointing in past sessions when I‚Äôd sell dozens of tickets but still only have 20 or so people attend the live event,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;Making the events 100% free to watch live serves a bunch of different purposes. First, it makes the event accessible to someone where the cost could be a blocker (blocker in a sense of &#8216;I don‚Äôt yet know if this resource is worth the investment,&#8217; not &#8216;I don‚Äôt think I can afford this,&#8217; because the sessions were already super cheap).</p>
<p>&#8220;Second, it encourages people to actually show up and participate, rather than just sitting back and thinking &#8216;I don‚Äôt need to make it live because I can just watch it whenever.'&#8221;</p>
<h3>Reviving WPSessions Sales with Cheaper Pricing and Free Live Events</h3>
<p>WPSessions dropped off the map for a short spell from December to March when Richards struggled to get presenters to commit to scheduling. With the new plan in place, he already has the next five presentations locked in and more on the line.</p>
<p>WPSessions currently has 100 <a href="http://wpsessions.com/vip/" target="_blank">VIP Members</a>, and Richards hopes to grow that number to 400 this year. He&#8217;s not worried about a loss of revenue with the drastically reduced session pricing.</p>
<p>&#8220;My data shows that most (upwards of 90%) of sales on each session happen within the first two months, and then drop off dramatically after that,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>&#8220;If anything, I think this may actually lead to an increase in revenue from the sessions, because it‚Äôs incredibly easy for someone to show up for free and see what WPSessions is all about, and because the back catalog is now so much less expensive.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Future of WPSessions in the WordPress Education Space</h3>
<p>Richards is currently working on producing an intensive WordPress Training Curriculum for developers. The first module, <a href="http://wpsessions.com/learn-wordpress-website-mastery/" target="_blank">WordPress Website Mastery</a>, will be going up next Monday.</p>
<p>&#8220;The overall goal of this will be to take someone in any field and teach them the necessary skills to become a profitable WordPress developer ‚Äì either as an independent contractor, or by joining the ranks of an agency,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>The long term goal for WP Sessions is to provide the most comprehensive collection of WordPress training materials that exists anywhere. Entrepreneurs are building new products for WordPress every day but very few have ventured into the WP education space to train developers. Richards has found that it&#8217;s not the easiest market to tackle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Developers are a fickle bunch,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They like to figure things out for themselves and hack around the internet until they find the answer to a specific problem they‚Äôre facing. It‚Äôs hard to introduce them to a specific training track because what they want to learn and what they need to learn are often two wholly different things. I know, because I am one.&#8221;</p>
<p>The WordPress ecosystem does not have an official, respected training certification for developers. While various training sites offer instruction, ranging from site management to development, WPSessions is rare in that it pulls in knowledge from presenters in all corners of the WordPress community.</p>
<p>&#8220;I have yet to find a site that offers the curriculum I&#8217;m looking to provide, which is a full-on cradle-to-grave instruction on Development 101 all the way through to Advanced Techniques, while also hitting on design basics, business development, marketing, and all the other skills an independent contractor needs to have in their wheel house,&#8221; he said.</p>
<p>WPSessions isn&#8217;t currently a full-time endeavor, but Richards is working on getting it there this year. By opening up the live events for free, he&#8217;s hoping to expand his audience and attract more customers to his catalog of learning resources.</p>

<p>The library is made up of previous hacks on major websites and services. For example, if your password was leaked during the <a title="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_LinkedIn_hack">LinkdIn hack in 2012</a>, Wordfence will inform you that it&#8217;s no longer safe to use.</p>

<p>I audited the passwords of all users on the Tavern test site and no weak passwords were discovered. I changed my password to <strong>password </strong>and within seconds, Wordfence detected a weak password.</p>

<p>When a weak password is detected, you can email selected users and request that they change it to a strong one. Alternatively, you can let Wordfence change it to a strong one automatically and email it to the user.</p>
<p>Wordfence explains how the auditing process works.</p>
<blockquote><p>Internally this feature uses a double layer of encryption to protect your data during the audit. First, we encrypt the hashes we are going to operate on using a combination of AES encryption and RSA public key encryption.</p>
<p>Then we send your encrypted data via SSL to our servers which provides a second layer of encryption. Once on our servers, the data is stored encrypted until it is audited and we never return sensitive data to your website.</p></blockquote>
<p>Although WordPress 3.7 added an <a title="http://wptavern.com/ridiculously-smart-password-meter-coming-to-wordpress-3-7" href="http://wptavern.com/ridiculously-smart-password-meter-coming-to-wordpress-3-7">improved password strength meter</a>, WordPress doesn&#8217;t enforce password strength for new users. After performing an audit, I recommend turning on the option in Wordfence to enforce strong passwords for new users. This way, you&#8217;ll know that all passwords from that point forward are strong.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, SplashRiver <a title="http://splashdata.com/press/worst-passwords-of-2014.htm" href="http://splashdata.com/press/worst-passwords-of-2014.htm">released its list</a> of the 25 worst passwords used in 2014. The passwords include, 123456, password, and 12345. Password auditing in Wordfence is a convenient way to make sure none of the users on your site are using weak passwords like those in the report.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 14 Apr 2015 19:51:39 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"
